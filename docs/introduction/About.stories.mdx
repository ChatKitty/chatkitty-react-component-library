# <u>ChatKitty React Chat Component Library</u>

ChatKitty's React component library is the fastest way to build full-stack chat. This library offers:

- Hooks that interact directly with ChatKitty's chat backend.
- Presentational chat components (channels, message lists, typing indicators).
- UI Customization through themes and CSS classes.

The library is designed with a few core principles in mind:

- **Fast time-to-value**. Components and hooks can be composed to build full-feature, full-stack chat solutions in record time.
- **Simple and extensible**. Components solve core use-cases and are easily extendable. Try building your own!
- **Readily customizable**. Themes and CSS classes can be readily configured and customized.
- **Strong typing**. We're bullish on typescript.
